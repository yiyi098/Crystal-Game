# Crystal Game

[Link to app](https://yiyi098.github.io/Crystal-Game/)

### Overview

There are be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     * Once a crystal is clicked, update the player's score counter.

   * The player wins if the total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if the score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

     * When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses.
